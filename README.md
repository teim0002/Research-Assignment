Bootstrap is one of the most popular and widely used open-source CSS frameworks, initially developed by Twitter.
Bootstrap is well-documented, and its extensive community support makes it a reliable choice for both beginners and experienced developers.
In my opinion, Bootstrap is an excellent choice for anyone looking to streamline the web development process. Its responsiveness and mobile-first approach make it incredibly suitable for creating modern websites that need to be compatible with various devices and screen sizes. The availability of numerous customizable components allows developers to maintain consistency in design while saving time that would otherwise be spent writing CSS from scratch.
